# Roadmaps

This directory contains implementation plans, phase roadmaps, and project timelines.

## What Goes Here

- High-level implementation plans
- Phase-by-phase roadmaps
- Weekly/daily task breakdowns
- Completed roadmaps (move to `complete/` subdirectory)

## Naming Convention

- **Always prefix with date:** `YYYY-MM-DD_description.md`
- Examples:
  - `2026-02-12_mvp-implementation-plan.md`
  - `2026-02-12_phase-1-foundation.md`
  - `2026-02-15_week-1-tasks.md`

## Workflow

1. Create roadmap in this directory
2. Reference in [changelog.md](../changelog.md)
3. Track progress (check off tasks as completed)
4. When fully implemented, move to `complete/` subdirectory
5. Update changelog with completion notes

## Examples from Research

- **Daniel:** [daniel/ai/roadmaps/](../../daniel/ai/roadmaps/) - 6 phase roadmaps + detailed plans
- **McKay:** [mckay/ai/roadmaps/](../../mckay/ai/roadmaps/) - 11 phase implementation plans
- **Dylan:** [dylan/ai/roadmaps/](../../dylan/ai/roadmaps/) - 6 phase roadmaps for 7-week timeline
