# Cursor AI Guidelines

## Project Context
📍 **Always read first:** `aiDocs/context.md`

This file has the current project state, tech stack, and what we're focused on right now.

## Key Principles
- **Ask before complex work** - Confirm approach for big decisions
- **Keep it simple** - MVP mindset, not production
- **Flag uncertainty** - Don't guess, ask
- **Demo-focused** - Working > perfect

## File Organization
- `aiDocs/` - Shared project docs (PRD, MVP, context)
- `ai/` - Local workspace (gitignored, my notes/guides)
